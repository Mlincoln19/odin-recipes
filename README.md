My current project is to create a website with and index page and links to various other pages that contain recipes.
Once finished I will have showcased the ability to make a web-page, link it to other web-pages, make lists- both ordered and unordered-, and successfully use git commits and other resources to ensure good and ordered progress. Hopefully.
